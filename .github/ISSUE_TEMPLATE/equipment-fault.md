**Which piece of equipment?**
Some things, like oars and ergos, can be tricky.  Most oars have serial numbers, and a photo of those is good.  Be sure to send us to the right boathouse.

**Whereabouts on it?**
For boats, this means seat numbers.

**What's wrong?**
The trick is to supply enough info so people can bring the right tools and/or parts without making a second trip.

**Photos**
Please attach photos if you have them, or mail them to equipment@chestertonrowingclub.org.

 **Urgency**
If equipment is unusable and you know when it's next needed, please say here.
